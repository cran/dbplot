\title{Returns a dataframe with boxplot calculations}
\usage{
db_compute_boxplot(data, x, var, coef = 1.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A table (tbl)}

\item{x}{A discrete variable in which to group the boxplots}

\item{var}{A continuous variable}

\item{coef}{Length of the whiskers as multiple of IQR. Defaults to 1.5}
}
\description{
Uses very generic dplyr code to create boxplot calculations.  
Because of this approach,
the calculations automatically run inside the database if `data` has
a database or sparklyr connection. The `class()` of such tables
in R are: tbl_sql, tbl_dbi, tbl_spark

It currently only works with Spark and Hive connections.
